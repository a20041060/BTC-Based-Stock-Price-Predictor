## Method 1: Easy Run (Recommended for simple setup)

This method uses the included script to set up a virtual environment and install everything for you.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3** must be installed. (Open Terminal and type `python3 --version`. If not found, install via Homebrew: `brew install python`)

### Steps
1. Unzip the folder `btc_predictor_mac`.
2. Open the **Terminal** app.
3. Type `cd ` (with a space) and drag the unzipped folder into the terminal window to set the path, then press **Enter**.
   Example:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/btc_predictor_mac
   ```
4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_on_mac.sh
   ./run_on_mac.sh
   ```
5. The application will install dependencies and open in your browser automatically.

## Method 2: Manual Python Setup

If you prefer to run commands manually:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/btc_predictor_mac
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run btc_stock_predictor_ui.py
   ```

## Method 3: Docker (Containerized)

If you have Docker Desktop installed, this is the cleanest method as it keeps your system tidy.

### Steps
1. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder.
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t btc-predictor .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 btc-predictor
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8501`

## Notes
- **First Run**: The first time you run the app, it may take a moment to download the FinBERT AI model (approx 400MB) for sentiment analysis.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues with "transformers" or "torch", ensure your Python version is 3.10 or newer.
